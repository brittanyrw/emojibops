  Important Notes:
  
  
  There is a limit to the number of pull requests you can make on this project due to the large amount of activity. Please limit yourself to up to 4 additions to this project. (Example: Complete 1 feature and add three songs, complete 4 Issues for song and add one feature, add four songs, etc). The limit will be removed in the future but for now I want to allow as many people as possible to have the chance contribute.
