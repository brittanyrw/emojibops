  Important Notes:
  
  
  We are limiting contributions per person to 3 additions across EmojiScreen, EmojiBops and EmojiPages. Please limit yourself to up to 3 additions across the three emoji projects. (Example One: Complete 1 feature, add two movies; Example Two: add three songs; Example Three: add one song, one movie and one book, etc). This is due to the high level of activity on these projects at the moment. We want to make sure many people have a chance to contribute. The limit will be lifted once the activity has died down. 🙂
